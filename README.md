## How to use

### Common stuff

The middle tier logic for handling the HTTP calls to the service is handled by the `RealTimePassengerInformation.Service.Client` module. A `Client.T` must be passed into any of the library's public functions. The module provides the `defaultClient` value that should normally be used.

### Get information about a bus stop

To get information about a single bus stop by its ID use the `getBusStopInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let info:Async<Result<BusStopInformation.T, ApiError>> =
    BusStopInformation.getBusStopInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient {bus stop ID}
```

Searching bus stops by operator and name are coming soon.

### Get the timetable for a route at a given bus stop

To get information about a given route at a given bus stop use the `getFullTimetableInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let info:Async<Result<FullTimeTableInformation.T, ApiError>> =
    FullTimeTableInformation.getFullTimetableInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient {bus stop ID} {bus stop route}
```

### Get all the operators known to RTPI

To get a list of all operators known to RTPI use the `getOperatorInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let info:Async<Result<OperatorInformation.T, ApiError>> =
    OperatorInformation.getOperatorInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient
```

### Get a list of real-time arrivals for a given bus stop

To get a list of the real-time arrivals expected at any bus stop use the `getRealTimeBusInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let busStopId : int = ...
...
let info:Async<Result<RealTimeBusInformation.T, ApiError>> =
    RealTimeBusInformation.getRealTimeBusInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient busStopId
```

### Get information about a given route (run by a given operator)

To get information about a route run by a given operator use the `getRouteInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let route : string = ...
...
let operatorReferenceCode : string = ...
...
let info:Async<Result<RouteInformation.T list, ApiError>> =
    RealTimeBusInformation.getRouteInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient route operatorReferenceCode
```

This may be refactored in the future as a `list` result may not be required.

I will also look into removing the need for the operator parameter, either from the calls to the RTPI service or via some additional logic that will insert it for the caller.

### Get a list of all routes (associated with their operators)

The `RouteListInformation` module provides functions to do this.

#### Not filtering by operator

To get a summary of all routes run regardless of operator use the `getRouteListInformation` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let info:Async<Result<RouteListInformation.T list, ApiError>> =
    RouteListInformation.getRouteListInformation
        Service.Client.defaultClient
```

#### Filtering for a given operator

To get routes run by just one operator use the `getRouteListInformationForOperator` function.

```fsharp
open RealTimePassengerInformation.Bus
...
let operatorReferenceCode : string = ...
...
let info:Async<Result<RouteListInformation.T, ApiError>> =
    RouteListInformation.getRouteListInformationForOperator
        Service.Client.defaultClient operatorReferenceCode
```

If you just need information for one operator let this function do the filtering for you, as it is actually the RTPI service that does the filtering which lowers the amount of data transfered over the network.
