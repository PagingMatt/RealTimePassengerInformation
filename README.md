### .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file for this repository was initially generated by [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/). To generate the same file I started with go [here](https://www.gitignore.io/api/fsharp). To enable Snyk I had to modify this file, commit [eb2307e](https://github.com/m-harrison/RealTimePassengerInformation/commit/eb2307e95678c38a35fa98982cdefa53e99576b7) shows the modifications that were made. gitignore.io in no way endorses me or this project.
